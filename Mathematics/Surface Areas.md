# Surface Areas

The surface area of a prism can be found using 2B+Ph, where B is the base area, P is the base's perimeter, and h is the prism's height.

The surface area of a cylinder can be found using 2pi r^2 + 2pi rh where h is its height and r is the radius of its circular faces.

The surface area of a pyramid or a cone is B + 1/2 Ps, where B is base, P is perimeter of the base and s is the inclined side.
